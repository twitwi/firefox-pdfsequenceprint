
Simple firefox extension to export html presentations.
It simply does in a loop:
 - print current page as pdf
 - simulate a right-arrow key press

The export can be started and stopped via menu items.

The exported files are /tmp/test-pdfsequnenceprint-*.pdf ... which obviously needs to be improved.
